# Data-Science-with-Python

This repository contains 3 files which were a part of a data science/analytics project I conducted with some peers. We analyzed and drew insights from Chicago Taxi Cab data which can be found via kaggle. One file is our presentation slides explaining our project. Another is the jupiter notebook with our code, and the third is a pdf of the code and our notes/comments.
